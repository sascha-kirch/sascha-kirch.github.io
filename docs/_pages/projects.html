    <p> I build AI systems that bridge research and production deployment—from generative
        models for 3D reconstruction to multi-sensor perception systems processing
        high-volume data in real-time. My work spans the full stack: deep learning
        architectures, classical computer vision, hardware design (FPGA/ASIC), and
        production system optimization.</p>

    <p>Projects range from published IEEE research (diffusion models, state space models)
        to production-scale perception systems deployed globally. Each demonstrates
        technical depth, systems thinking, and the ability to translate cutting-edge AI
        into real-world solutions under real-time constraints.</p>
